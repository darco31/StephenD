## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ My name is StephenD and I am an aspiring web developer and over all tech enthusiast.
I live in Dublin, Ireland and currently work as a business analyst.

I am currently learning with [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net) and
progressing toward a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.

I was for a two-month period assigned to be a channel lead on Slack for the Code Institute's Portfolio one channel assisting students with issues in their first project which is mainly focusing on HTML and CSS.

I have always had an interest in learning to code. Now I am doing it and loving every minute of it. My plan is to land a junior role with a firm and to continue my learning after the course has reached its conclusion.
